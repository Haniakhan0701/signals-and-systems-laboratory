Title: Practical 04 – Periodic, Aperiodic, Even & Odd Signals

Objective:
To understand and analyze periodicity, evenness, and oddness of signals using MATLAB. Also, to visualize periodic waveforms like tooth, square, and sine-based signals.

Key Concepts:
- Periodic vs. Aperiodic Signals
- Even and Odd Signal Identification
- Waveform Generation using MATLAB
- Angular Frequency ω = 2πf
- Discrete vs. Continuous Signal Representation

Questions:

Q1: Plot two sinusoids to demonstrate discrete-time and continuous-time periodic and non-periodic functions for:
    n = -2:12
    x1[n] = sin(4n)
    x2[n] = sin((4πn)/5)
    Also, comment on whether signals are even or odd.

Q2: Plot a periodic sawtooth waveform.

Q3: Plot a periodic square waveform.

Q4: Plot a periodic sine wave using:
    f = 50 Hz, fs = 10 kHz, display 6 cycles (both continuous and discrete time)
