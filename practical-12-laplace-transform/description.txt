Practical 12 â€“ Laplace Transform in MATLAB

Objective:
To compute the Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms of standard time-domain functions using MATLAB's Symbolic Math Toolbox.

Key Concepts:
- Laplace transform: Converts time-domain functions into s-domain
- Inverse Laplace: Converts s-domain functions back to time-domain
- Useful for analyzing linear time-invariant systems

Examples Performed:
1. Laplace of exp(-2t)
2. Laplace of sin(3t)
3. Inverse Laplace of (1 / (s^2 + 4s + 5))

Expected Output:
Symbolic expressions of the Laplace and inverse Laplace results.

Note:
Requires the Symbolic Math Toolbox.
