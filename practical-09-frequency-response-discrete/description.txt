Title: Practical 09 – Frequency Response of Discrete-Time Signal

Objective:
To analyze the frequency response of a discrete-time system using MATLAB and interpret its magnitude and phase behavior.

Theory:
The frequency response of a system shows how it reacts to different frequency components in the input signal. It is defined as H(e^jω), and its:
- **Magnitude response** shows gain vs frequency.
- **Phase response** shows phase shift vs frequency.

Functions Used:
- `freqz()`: calculates frequency response of digital filters.
- `plot()`: used for plotting magnitude and phase.

Conclusion:
We successfully computed and visualized the frequency response. These plots help in understanding the filter characteristics and signal behavior in the frequency domain.
