Title: Practical 08 – Impulse Response of Discrete-Time Signal

Objective:
To determine and visualize the impulse and step response of a discrete-time system in MATLAB using a given transfer function.

Theory:
- The **impulse response** of a system is its output when the input is a unit impulse (δ[n]).
- The **step response** is the output when the input is a unit step (u[n]).
- These responses characterize the behavior of LTI systems completely.

In this lab, we used a difference equation defined by a transfer function:
H(z) = (1 + z^-1) / (1 - 0.5*z^-1)

Q1:
Given transfer function H(z), we applied a unit impulse and unit step to the system using MATLAB’s `filter()` function to find:
- Impulse response h[n]
- Step response s[n]

Functions Used:
- `filter()`: computes the output of an LTI system
- `stem()`: plots discrete-time signals
- `saveas()`: saves figures

Conclusion:
The system response to both impulse and step inputs was successfully computed and plotted. These responses are essential for understanding system stability and behavior.
