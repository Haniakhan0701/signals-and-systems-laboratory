Title: Practical 03 – Continuous and Discrete Time Signals

Objective:
To explore the concept and implementation of continuous and discrete time signals using MATLAB.

Key Concepts:
- Analog (Continuous) vs. Digital (Discrete) Signals
- Real vs. Complex Signals
- Deterministic vs. Random Signals
- Signal visualization using `plot()` and `stem()`

Questions:

Q1: Draw a continuous and discrete-time signal for:
    y = sin(2πf*t), where f = 10Hz, fs = 100Hz, t = 0 to 1 sec

Q2: Plot continuous and discrete-time signal for:
    y = 3sin(2πf*t) + 2cos((2πf/2)*t), f = 20Hz, fs = 100Hz, t = 0 to 2 sec

Q3: Draw a unit ramp for continuous and discrete time

Q4: Draw an exponential signal (continuous and discrete)
