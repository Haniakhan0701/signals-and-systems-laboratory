Practical 11 – Fourier Series Using MATLAB

Objective:
To approximate a periodic signal (square wave) using its Fourier series representation.

Details:
- The signal considered is a square wave, which is an odd periodic function.
- Only odd harmonics are used in the series due to signal symmetry.
- The Fourier coefficients are calculated using the standard formula:
  
  x(t) ≈ Σ (4/pi) * (1/n) * sin(n*w0*t) for odd n

- The script plots both the original square wave and its Fourier approximation.

Expected Output:
A graph showing the original square wave and its smoother approximation using 10 harmonics.
