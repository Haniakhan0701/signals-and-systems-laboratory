Title: Practical 02 â€“ 2D Plotting and Trigonometric Graphs

Objective:
To understand 2D plotting functions in MATLAB and visualize various trigonometric functions using subplots and multiple curves.

Key Concepts:
- 2D plotting using `plot(x, y)`
- Multiple curves on the same graph
- `subplot()` for arranging multiple graphs
- Trigonometric functions: cosine, tangent, arctangent

Questions:
Q1: What is subplotting in MATLAB?
Ans: Subplotting in MATLAB allows multiple plots to be displayed in a single figure window using the `subplot(m, n, p)` command, where `m` is rows, `n` is columns, and `p` is the plot index.

Q2: Paste the output of the MATLAB code provided (tangent and arctangent graphs).
Q3: Write MATLAB code to plot the following:
    - Cosine graph
    - Tangent graph
    - Arctangent graph
