Title: Practical 10 â€“ Generating Signals Using Simulink

Objective:
To understand the use of Simulink for generating signals and explore its graphical modeling environment.

Theory:
Simulink is a MATLAB-based graphical programming environment used for modeling, simulating, and analyzing dynamic systems. It includes:
- A graphical editor for model construction
- A customizable block library
- Time-based solvers
- Interactive model exploration tools

Simulink is widely used in signal processing, control systems, communications, and embedded systems.

Task:
1. Open Simulink and create a new model.
2. Use the "Sine Wave" block from the Simulink library.
3. Connect it to a "Scope" block to visualize the signal.
4. Run the simulation and observe the output waveform.

Comment:
Simulink simplifies the modeling of complex systems using a block-diagram approach. It allows users to simulate signal behavior without writing code, making it ideal for visual learners and rapid prototyping.

Conclusion:
Simulink provides an intuitive interface to create and simulate signal systems effectively. It is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of various systems visually.
