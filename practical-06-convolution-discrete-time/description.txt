Title: Practical 06 – Convolution of Discrete-Time Signals in MATLAB

Objective:
To understand the concept of convolution and its implementation in MATLAB for discrete-time signals.

Theory:
Convolution is a mathematical operation used to express the relation between input and output of an LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) system. In MATLAB, the `conv()` function is used to compute the convolution of two signals.

Q1:
Given:
  x[n] = [0.5 0.5 0.5]
  h[n] = [3.0 2.0 1.0]
Performed convolution using MATLAB’s `conv()` function and plotted the result.

Q2:
Given:
  x[n] = [1 2 3]
  h[n] = [1 1]
Performed convolution using MATLAB and plotted the result to visualize the output signal.

Tools: MATLAB Online 
Functions Used: conv(), stem(), saveas()

Conclusion:
The convolution results from MATLAB matched theoretical calculations, validating the accuracy of the `conv()` function for LTI system analysis.
