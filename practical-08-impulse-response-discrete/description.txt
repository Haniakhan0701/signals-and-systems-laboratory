Title: Practical 03 – Continuous and Discrete Time Signals

Objective:
To understand and implement the concept of continuous-time and discrete-time signals in MATLAB.

Key Concepts:
- Continuous vs. Discrete domain
- Time vector generation
- Plotting using stem() and plot()

Expected Output:
Two graphs – one for continuous-time and one for discrete-time signal.
