Title: Practical 05 â€“ Signal Operations

Objective:
To perform fundamental signal operations such as addition, multiplication, scaling, shifting, and folding on discrete-time signals using MATLAB.

Key Concepts:
- Discrete-time Signal Representation
- Signal Addition and Multiplication
- Signal Shifting (Time Delay and Advance)
- Signal Folding (Time Reversal)

Questions:

Q1: Take two discrete-time signals and perform addition operation.

Q2: Perform multiplication operation on the two discrete-time signals.

Q3: Shift a discrete-time signal to the right (delay) and to the left (advance).
